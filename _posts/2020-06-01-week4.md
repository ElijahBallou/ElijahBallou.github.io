I was tasked to create the python verision of the code that will read in a file, cconvert the (.png or text.) and use levenshtien distance, to create a new iOCR Json file.
Then to send the Json to display to HTML , without using a local server. This is completed and when we used the code in the lab it became more difficult since it was used in previous device.
Still adjusting the code and it is coming along really well.
