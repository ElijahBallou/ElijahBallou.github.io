We met and discussed the different direction we want the application to function if it could be on
windows or if it could be stateless, using either python or JavaScript.Then I was tasked to take a regular ballot and convert it to Html format. once completed I was instructed to read a couple of papers like: "RISK MANAGEMENT FOR ELECTRONIC BALLOT DELIVERY, MARKING, AND RETURN", "A Study of Ballot Anomaly Detection with a Transparent Voting Machine". After that I was given a brief demo of how it works. Fianlly i was tasked to use the scanners to see which one is easier to navigate when scanning ballots.
