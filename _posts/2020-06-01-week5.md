title: Week 5 - Increaseing the accuracy of iOCR
---

After the first 50 ballots scanned with the pyhton iOCR code, it was determined the program was 80% accurate.
I was tasked to take my code and to reorganize it to make it more acccurate with scanning. 
Taking it out meaningless codes and replace it with more efficient code.
Then to scan more ballots with the new code to hopfully increase the accuracy of results.
