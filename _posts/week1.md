When I started the project I was in countless meetings. Then I was tasked to find particular scanners that were: Linux and Windows compatible, Included the OCR software, and able to be mobile. after completing that , I was tasked to research "what makes a Webpage Screen reader friendly ?" , and "what are the best practices of designing a webpage that is screen reader friendly ?", and to learn about "tesseract". finally was to read about Risk Management for Electronic Ballot Delivery, Marking, and Return.
