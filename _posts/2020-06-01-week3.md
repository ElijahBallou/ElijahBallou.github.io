title: Week 3 - Testing out Ballots through OCR
---

Once I have did my test run with the scanner that yeild the best results we configured an plan to use a different Optical Character Recognition(OCR) than the one built-in the scanner. we decided tesseract to be out other OCR, and used the scanner to test out how accurate its OCR was in different font sizes from both scanners. I was then tasked to program code to do thesame thing the built in scanner is doing but in python, then once that was complete I was than tasked to compare the txt.file scan to the ballot definition using Levenshtein Distance. still working on the Levenshtein distance to be alot more accurate with the write-ins on the ballots.
